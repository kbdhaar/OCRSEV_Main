The Ontology of Cancer-Related Social Ecological Variables was developed to facilitate semantic integration (SDI) of disparate data. Current version V1.0 was built based on PCORnet CDM 4.0 specification, BRFSS SMART data and Medicare data. Simulated data and SPARQL queries used for validating the ontology are also available in this repository.
